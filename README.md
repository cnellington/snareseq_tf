# SNARE-seq Transcription Factor Analysis

### jupyter notebook, python 3.7.3

This workflow was made to assess previously unknown TF-gene relations by evaluating the joint single-cell transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data published with the [SNARE-seq method](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0290-0#data-availability)
- sig_peaks.fasta is a list of all open chromatin regions with a significant effect on gene expression (multiple-hypothesis 2-sided t-test)
- snareseq_tfs.csv is a document of the tf-gene pairs found by using this prototype workflow
